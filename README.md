# 🎡 **Roulette Curves: Cycloids, Trochoids & Beyond**

Explore the mesmerising world of **roulette curves** — from cycloids to hypotrochoids and epitrochoids — using Python, math, and animations.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that dives deep into **roulette curves**, a fascinating class of curves generated by the rolling motion of one curve on another. Through interactive plots, visualizations, and animations, this project unpacks both the theory and beauty of these curves.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🔁 **Trochoids**
- Rolling of a circle along a **straight line**.
- Discussed and visualized:
  - **Common Cycloids**
  - **Curtate Cycloids**
  - **Prolate Cycloids**
- Generalized via a reusable `Trochoids` class.
- Animated rolling motion with traced paths.

### 🔵 **Hypotrochoids**
- Rolling of a circle **inside** another circle.
- Special cases:
  - **Hypocycloids**
  - **Rose Curves**
  - **Ellipses**
- Investigated how the ratio $n = \frac{a}{b}$ (fixed to rolling circle radius) influences shape, periodicity, and closure.

### 🔴 **Epitrochoids**
- Rolling of a circle **outside** another circle.
- Special cases:
  - **Epicycloids**
  - **Rose Curves**, **Circles**, **Limacons**
- Explored behaviour under different values of $n$.

### ⏳ **Tautochronic Property of Cycloids**
- Showcased the unique property where all particles take the **same time** to reach the bottom of an inverted cycloid, regardless of starting point.
- Simulated:
  - **Cycloidal Pendulum** motion
  - Balls sliding along the path simultaneously
- Illustrated using animations and physics-based modelling.
